Third-Party APIs: Daily Planner App


## Description

This HTML, CSS and JavaScript project is created to support employees with busy schedules during their working hours, on daily bases and improve their time efficiency.

## Installation

There is no installation required.

## Usage

Work Day Scheduler app gives you a field for all daily events, which you can add into the colored field just next to it's start hour. Once the event is added, you have to click the save button in blue on the other side. Remember to save your changes every time a correction is made, even if you are removing events. If you don't use the save button all changes will be lost!

When you open the scheduler during your working hours you'll see each day of the week is, the month and the exact date. Under the solid black line you can see a form which contains column with all round hours, save button in blue and field for your events to add in three different colors:

Grey shows you the events in the past hours.
Red indicates that the event start time is now.
Green presents the upcoming events.
